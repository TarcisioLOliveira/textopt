# Information related to texture dimensions and scaling.
texture:
  # Dimensions of the region being analyzed (in number of equally spaced points).
  # E.g. a 400x400 space has 360000 points. With each one being spaced by 1 um,
  # that gives a base area of 399x399 = 159201 um^2.

  tex_height: 400
  # Unit scaling. Currently defaulting to um as base unit for texture.
  # There is naive support for different scales in different directions,
  # but it may break tool radius and ellipse shape if they're different.
  # Defaults to same scale to all sides.
